  <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

  <p>
    Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
    Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end
    tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.
    Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web,
    mobile, or the desktop
  </p>

  <p>
    Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly
    related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as
    dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both components and services are simply classes, with decorators that mark
    their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The metadata for a component class associates it with a template that
    defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular directives
    and binding markup that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it
    for display.
